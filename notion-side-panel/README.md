# Notion Side Panel Extension

This Chrome extension opens a web page inside Chrome's side panel. It remembers the last page you visited so that the next time you open the panel you return to that page.

## Usage
1. Load the extension in Chrome by navigating to `chrome://extensions` and enabling **Developer mode**.
2. Click **Load unpacked** and select this `notion-side-panel` folder.
3. Click the extension's toolbar icon to open the side panel.
4. Use the text field at the top to enter a new URL if desired. The last URL is stored in browser storage.

By default, it loads the provided Notion page.
